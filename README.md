## Introduction
Despite the prosperity of generative models, the risks and challenges posed by AIGC cannot be overlooked. This paper pioneers an exploration into the impact of synthetic images on hallucination problems during the reasoning process of Large Vision Language Models. Extensive experimental results have confirmed a significant deviation between synthetic image- and natural image-induced hallucination, referring to as the hallucination bias.

## Update
- [9/1] Source code of ImageTranslation will be released soon.
- [9/1] We release the synthetic image dataset FakeAMBER [LINK](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1WfqVhXqeQudMFMMrWA4r1w?pwd=d54y).
- [7/16] 🎉🎉🎉 Our work is **accepted** to ACMMM 2024！

## Overview

We establish an evaluation environment for hallucinations involving synthetic images. Specifically, we introduce an automated annotation method (Semantic Translation) for unlabeled synthetic image datasets, where the generation process of synthetic images remains unchanged. This approach ensures the authenticity and consistency of the synthetic images, providing a foundation for quantitative analysis in subsequent hallucination evaluations. 

## Results

The main findings regarding hallucinations induced by synthetic images include (1) **a greater quantity** and (2) **a more uniform position distribution of hallucinated contents**.
